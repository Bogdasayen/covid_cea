Decision tree cost-effectiveness analysis of public health response to covid-19
Full description of model available on Medrxiv here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.14.20248201v1
Uses predictions of cases, hospitalisations, and deaths generated by LSHTM CMMID open-source model: https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases
Compares to reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths that must be extracted from suitable sources
For each included Country, the model uses lifetables, age distribution at death, and age-specific QALY norms to calculate QALYs lost per death
Compares the health-related net benefit (at £20k and £30k per QALY) to GDP loss scenarios. Again, refer to the pre-print for details.
